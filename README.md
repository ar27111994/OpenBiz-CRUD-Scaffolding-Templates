C.R.U.D. Scaffolding Templates for OpenBiz with AJAXifiied searching, sorting, paging and exporting as Excel &amp; Csv file of Current page / All Data. In essence a complete Webgrid Experience built with a [Generic Repository Pattern](https://github.com/ar27111994/Generic-Repository-Pattern) on top of Entity Framework 6.

# Usage
- Put the Controller and Views in your **Templates** Directory. For Example for **Visual Studio 2015**, it is located in: 
```System-Drive-Letter:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\Common7\IDE\Extensions\Microsoft\Web\Mvc\Scaffolding\Templates```.
- Place **crud-modal.js** file in your Project and reference it in your **BundleConfig.cs** or any other appropriate file depending on your **ASP.NET MVC** Version, so that you can use the *Ajaxified C.R.U.D.* functionality of controller and Views.
